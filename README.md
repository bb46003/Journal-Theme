# Journal Styler

Created in collaboration with **Immersive Realms**  
**Code:** BartekB | **UI and Journal Themes:** DeviousHearts  

---

## Overview

The **Journal Styler** module allows each user to easily customize the look of Foundry VTT journals independently.  
Every player and GM can choose their own favorite **Journal Style** for each individual journal entry in the game.

---

## How It Works

In the **journal header**, you’ll find a new **palette button** on the right:

Clicking this button opens a **style selection dialog**, where you can configure three main elements:

### 1. Theme  
Themes define the **background image**, and default **header** and **body fonts** for the journal text.  
You can choose from **10 predefined themes**:

### 2. Header Font  
Overrides the theme’s default header font for all heading elements in the journal.

### 3. Body Font  
Changes the default font for all non-header text in the journal.  

> These settings **do not override** fonts manually applied during text editing — your inline styles remain unchanged.

## GM Features

As the **Game Master**, you can set a **default theme** for all newly created journals in the module settings.  
The GM’s selected theme will be visible to all players until they change it for themselves.

You can also **restrict** players from changing themes or fonts.  
By default, any player who can view a journal can also change its appearance.  
However, this behavior can be limited by adjusting the **minimum ownership level** required to make style changes.

## Fonts

GMs can easily **add custom fonts**, either from **local files** or **Google Fonts**.  
Just make sure to enter the correct **font name** as it appears in the font file or on Google Fonts.

There’s no limit to how many fonts you can add.

The module also includes **120 fonts by default**, all available in the Foundry **Text Editor**:

## Text Editor Improvements

The module enhances the default Foundry text editor:

- The header selector is now separated into its own dropdown.  
- Bold, italic, and underline buttons have been reorganized for easier access.  
- A **font size selector** has been added, offering quick size adjustments:

## Summary

**Journal Styler** makes it simple for players and GMs to personalize their Foundry journals — with themes, fonts, and improved editing tools.  
Whether you’re creating a gritty noir logbook or a bright fantasy codex, you can now match your journal’s look to your story’s tone effortlessly.
